### Hardware project to display Raspberry Pi Sense Hat computers.  

As part of a CiCd demo I wanted to display a stack of Raspberry Pi's on stage.  
The demonstration showed a CiCd pipeline deploying across the Raspberries and changing the colors of Sense Hat LED arrays on the devices.  
This repo contains instructions for the associated hardware project.  
A separate repo contains the [software deployed to the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/seangreathouse/raspberry-sense-hat-demo).  

I am sharing the design with the thought that it could be helpful for other IoT display use-cases.

*The project name comes from the NHRA Drag race starting light "[Xmas Tree](https://www.nhra.com/news/2007/christmas-tree-story)"*
