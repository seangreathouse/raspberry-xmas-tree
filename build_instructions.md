## Build instructions  
*These instructions assume a moderate level of mechanical ability.*

### Raspberry Pi, Sense Hat & Zebra Case Assembly

Follow the instructions included with the case.  
The finished product should look like this:

### Mounting plates

[![](./images/thumb/template_example.png)](./images/full/template_example.png)   [![](./images/thumb/drilled_mounting_plate.jpg)](./images/full/drilled_mounting_plate.jpg)

+ Print a copy of the template from the /template directory of the project.  
*Measure the objects in the printout to ensure a 1:1 print scale*
+ The template has sets of four mounting plates laid out in a block.  
+ Lay the template on your 1/8" UHMW Plastic Sheet  
*Feel free to use other media.  [Aluminum](http://a.co/9ri0TRB) would work well if you know how to work with it.*  
*We chose UHMW plastic because it is stiff, strong and easy to work with.*  
*Our UMHW sheet had a warp to it that did not affect the outcome of the project.*  
+ Use the prick punch or nail to mark the corners of the rectangles for your cuts.  
+ Similarly mark the centers of the drill-holes.  
Deeper indentations will help keep the drill bit from 'walking'.  
+ Drill out the holes in the mouting plates.  
*Note that one of the 5/16" holes should be vertically elongated to allow for level adjustment later.*
+ Use a straight edge and utility knife to cut out the four mounting plates.  
*Start with an initial, very light cut, then apply more pressure for each successive cut*    
*This method is safer, and more effective.*
+ Black UMHW whitens if you sand it.  If you want to clean up rough edges I found that a [heat gun](http://a.co/92F7YUe) works well.   
*Be careful not to heat the UMHW to the point of shrinking or warping.*

### Zebra case bolt assemblies

[![](./images/thumb/zebra_bolt_assembly.jpg)](./images/full/zebra_bolt_assembly.jpg)  

[![](./images/thumb/zebra_bolt_assembly_parts.jpg)](./images/full/zebra_bolt_assembly_parts.jpg)


+ Get the #6 screws, washers, lock nuts & nuts.
+ One of the lock nuts in each of the 8 identical assemblies is threaded on nylon-side-first.  
To make this step easier pre-cut threads into the nylon by first threading it on the 'normal' way, then removing it from the screw.  

[![](./images/thumb/thread_nylon.jpg)](./images/full/thread_nylon.jpg)


+ Assemble as shown in the first image in this section.  
+ Attach the bolt assemblies to the mounting plates as shown below.    
With the last lock nut and washer on back side of the mounting plate.  
The screw-ends should be flush with the end of the nut on the back side of the mounting plate.  
*Note that there is a front and back to the mounting plate.*   
*The smaller bolt assemby holes are offset to the left when facing the front of the mounting plate.*   
+ Tighten the lock nuts sandwiching the mounting plate.  (Use two wrenches for best results.)  
+ The standard nut (closest to the bolt head) should be able to turn freely.  

[![](./images/thumb/zebra_case_mount.jpg)](./images/full/zebra_case_mount.jpg)


+ Test the spacing of the mounting plate bolt assemblies by sliding into the wall-mount holes on the back of the case.

### Cable clamp assembly & mounting

[![](./images/thumb/cable_clamp_parts.jpg)](./images/full/cable_clamp_parts.jpg)

+ Gather the 4 cable clamps, 8 M8 washers & 8 M8 lock nuts.    

****
### Mount cable clamps to lab stand

+ Slide the cable clamps on to the top of the lab stand post.
+ Space evenly with the top clamp at the very top of the lab stand post.
+ The Zebra cases are 2.75" so to have a 1.5" gap between them, I spaced the clamps 4.75" apart.  
+ Finger tighten the clamp nuts while you space and align the clamps.  
+ Tighten fully once you are satisfied with the result.  
*Note:  Moving the clamps later will require some dissasembly.*

### Attach mounting plates to cable clamps

+ Slide mounting plate on to clamp bolts.  
+ Install M8 washers and lock nuts.
+ Tighten nuts securely, but loose enough to rotate the mounting plate for levelling.  

[![](./images/thumb/plate_on_clamp_1.jpg)](./images/full/plate_on_clamp_1.jpg)  [![](./images/thumb/plate_on_clamp_2.jpg)](./images/full/plate_on_clamp_2.jpg)
  

+ Level the mounting plate by resting the level on the bolt heads, not the plate top.  
+ Once levelled, fully tighten the lock nuts.  

[![](./images/thumb/plate_level.jpg)](./images/full/plate_level.jpg)


+ Mount the Zebra case on to the mounting plate.  
+ Tighten the standard nut and washer against the case back to secure the case.

### Stand pre-cabling

### Cabling and cable management
 
+ Cut the cable management sleeve to match the height of the stand post.  
+ Singe the cut ends lightly with a candle or lighter to help prevent fraying.  
+ Wrap the cable management around the stand post.  
+ For a cleaner fit, cut triangle shaped wedges where the cable management meets the cable clamps. 
+ Singe the cuts to prevent fraying.  

[![](./images/thumb/cable_sleeve_cutout.jpg)](./images/full/cable_sleeve_cutout.jpg)

+ We found that two layers of cable management looked better.  
Repeat the steps above to wrap a second layer on to the post.  
+ Attach the usb power cables and optional ethernet cables to the Raspberries.  
+ Starting from the top, push the cables between the two layers of cable management.  
+ When complete, wrap zip ties around the outside of the post & cable management  
behind the Raspberries where they can't be seen.  
+ Zip tie the cables together where they egress the bottom of the cable management.

### Box for USB power, switch and cables

+ You need a relatively large (8"Lx5.5W"x4H") box to contain all the extra cables.
+ This size also matches the 8"x5.5" footprint of the lab stand so it can sit under the stand.
+ Drill a ~1.5" hole in the end of the box for cable ingress and egress.
